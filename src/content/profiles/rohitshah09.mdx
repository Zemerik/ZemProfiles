Hi, I am Rohit:

I began my coding journey in year 7 with basic python code in pycharm. I expanded my coding skills by starting to learn HTMl - CSS - Javascript. I started to create different projects with different complexities using basic HTML. I continued practicing Python by making different projects such as face recognistion and voice recognition.

Now I am learning more languages while continuing to work on my projects. I aim to learn more about open source and how to contribute to different projects through git and github. If you have any open source projects which I can contribute to, feel free to send them through my discord (vk_goat). 

Thanks for viewing my profile and reading about my journey!
